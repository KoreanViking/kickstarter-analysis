## An Analysis For Kickstarter Campaigns
# Project Overview: 
The purpose of this analysis is to get an idea of how kickstarter campaigns for Theater Plays performs based on the launch date, and based on their goal amount. Using these two we can look at trends between failed, and successful campaigns.  

# Analysis and Challenges:
To get out outcomes based on launch dates, I had to create a pivot table. On the pivot table we filtered by parent category to get Theater. From there we populated the data from the successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters and we graphed it. 

For our outcomes based on goals, we set a range of goal amounts and used a CountIFs formula to pull in the data accordingly. For example, for our successful campaigns under $1000, we asked the formula to give us the number of campaigns that were under the $1000 goal, with the criteria it had the Successful outcome, and under the Plays subcategory.

# Results: 
Looking at the line chart for Theater Outcomes by Launch date, I can make a conclusion that there is a trend around summer and holiday seasons. There is a large jump during the summer months, most noticeably the Successful outcome. Around December, we can see both outcomes almost meet. 

For the Outcomes Based on Goals chart, both lines are almost a mirror of each other. 
Based on the graph it shows that the lower the goal, the more successful campaigns there will be. The data lines intersect at the 15000 to 19000 goal amount. However later down the graph we see both a massive spike for successful outcomes, and a massive dip for failed outcomes. 

Some limitations of these charts would be the ability to see exact percentages. The line charts provide a good quick overview of successful, and failed campaigns over the course of time. However if we wanted to see exact percentage amounts I would recommend a bar graph. With a bar graph we can display the percentage, and we would still get a rough overview of progression.
